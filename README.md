A collection of four public real-world network throughput datasets for simulating various user and network conditions. All traces are pre-processed with the format of `[time_stamp (sec), throughput (Mbit/sec)]`. Refer to [Pensieve](https://github.com/confiwent/pensieve/tree/master/traces) for more details.

- _3G/HSDPA_ dataset, published in [Commute Path Bandwidth Traces from 3G Networks](https://qualinet.github.io/databases/commute_path_bandwidth_traces_from_3g_networks/), which is stored in `./cooked_3gp/` and `./traces_3gp`. 

- _FCC_ dataset, collected from [Raw Data-Measuring Broadband
America. (2016)](https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/measuring-broadband-america/raw-data-measuring-broadband-america-2016), which is stored in `./fcc_ori/`.

- _FCC & HSDPA_ dataset, which includes mixed traces from FCC and 3G/HSDPA and is stored in `./fcc_and_hsdpa/`.

- _Oboe_ dataset, published in [Oboe: auto-tuning video ABR algorithms to network conditions](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3230543.3230558), which is stored in `./traces_oboe/`.

- _Puffer_ dataset, collected from [Puffer platform](https://puffer.stanford.edu/). We precess all traces on two randomly chosen dates (Oct. 17, 2021 and Feb.
18, 2022), and the results are stored in `./puffer_211017/` and `./puffer_220218/`, respectively.

- `./load_webget_data.py` shows how to process raw Puffer traces.
